<h2 id="c3">THE CURASSOW.</h2>
<p>An interesting race of birds, known as
the Curassows, has its range throughout
that part of South America, east of the
Andes Mountain range and north of
Paraguay. All the species are confined
to this region except one, which is found
in Central America and Mexico. This is
the bird of our illustration (Crax globicera).</p>
<p>The Curassows belong to the order of
Gallinaceous birds and bear the same relation
to South America that the pheasants
and grouse bear to the Old
World. They are in every respect the
most important and the most perfect
game birds of the district which they inhabit.
In all there are twelve species
placed under four genera. As the hind
toes of the feet are placed on a level with
the others they resemble the pigeon and
are unlike many of the other gallinaceous
birds.</p>
<p>The Curassows are very large and
rather heavy birds and some of them are
larger than our turkey. They have short
wings and a strong bill. At the base of
the upper mandible and on the upper side
there is a large tubercle-like excrescence
which is of a yellow color and quite hard.
Upon the head there is a gracefully
arched crest of feathers which is made of
curled feathers, the tips of which are
white in some of the species. This crest
can be lowered or raised at the will of the
bird. The plumage of the species illustrated
is a beautiful and velvety black, except
the white on the lower portion of the
body. It is said that their motions are
much more graceful than are those of our
common domestic turkey. &ldquo;They live in
small flocks, and are arboreal in their
habits, only occasionally descending to
the ground, while roosting and building
their nests on the branches of trees.&rdquo; The
nests are large and made of twigs and
willowy branches held in place by the
stems of grasses, which are neatly interwoven
between them. The nest is lined
with down, feathers and leaves.</p>
<p>It is said that they are easily domesticated
and that in some parts of South
America they may be found in tame
flocks around the homes of the planters.
One authority states that at about the beginning
of the present century a large
number of Curassows were taken from
Dutch Guiana to Holland, where they became
thoroughly domesticated, breeding
as readily as any other kind of domestic
poultry. Though a tropical bird, it would
seem that they might be acclimatized.
They would certainly form a valuable addition
to the list of our farm fowls, for
their flesh is said to be &ldquo;exceedingly white
and delicate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The female is not as large as the male
and is usually reddish in color. Their
food consists almost entirely of fruit and
insects.</p>
<p>About the middle of the eighteenth century
Eleazar Albin wrote &ldquo;A Natural
History of Birds,&rdquo; in which he gives a
very interesting account of the Curassow
and an excellent illustration of the bird.
He says: &ldquo;I took a pourtray of this bird
at Chelmsford in Essex; it was very tame
and sociable, eating and drinking with
any company. The Cock I had of a man
from the West Indies. They are generally
brought from Carasow, from
whence they take their Name. They are
called by the Indians Tecuecholi, Mountain-Bird
or American Pheasant.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c4">SOME NOTABLE NESTS.</h2>
<p>The Clymer boys and girls, of Cloverdale,
New England, belonged to a Bird
Club; they were proposed to membership
by their neighbors, the Walkers; in fact,
the two families composed the club, and
it partook of the nature of a secret society.</p>
<p>All this was before the young people
of Cloverdale knew of Clark University,
and Dr. Hodges&rsquo; &ldquo;Ten to One Clubs,&rdquo;
wherein the members pledged themselves
to strive by all imaginable means&mdash;provided
they were also practical&mdash;to induce
ten song birds to live and sing each year,
where only one was found the year before.</p>
<p>It was not necessary for the Cloverdale
Club to put up carefully constructed and
artistic bird houses, or to hang cotton
and the like fine nest-building materials
in choicest ornamental shade trees&mdash;not
at all. The English Sparrow had not found
the village in those days; the song birds
were there, they knew all the good locations
and just where to find the best stuffs
for constructing, furnishing and decorating
their homes; the work of the club
was to find these homes, to study them,
with the ways and habits of their occupants,
and to record their discoveries in
a big book labeled, &ldquo;Things Not Generally
Known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many of the statements in this book
were as broad and conclusive as scientific
dogmas, but the Cloverdale Club did
not waste its time searching for hundreds
of instances to establish a single truth;
one was enough to be worthy of record;
then, if some time the big book should be
given to the public, and some naturalist
or investigator should choose to confirm
its statements by patient research, of
course he would be welcome so to do.
The club had the distinction of discovery,
that was enough.</p>
<p>One interesting item recorded was
this: &ldquo;Birds&mdash;such as Orioles&mdash;who
build in conspicuous places, like to decorate
the outside of their nests, and in so
doing are known to use manufactured
materials and patterns.&rdquo; Strange statement,
but of course thereby hangs a tale,
and here it is.</p>
<p>At the spring house-cleaning time,
Mrs. Clymer had the big, bright sitting-room
carpet taken out under one of the
old colonial elms, at the east of the house,
to be cleaned. Mrs. Baltimore Oriole
was up in the elm that morning looking
for a building spot that should be a bit
superior to the old one; she had spent
three summers in that tree, was familiar
with the ways of the club, and habits of
the family; like the birds of Eugene
Field&rsquo;s boyhood, &ldquo;she knew her business
when she built the old fire-hang-bird&rsquo;s
nest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one was near when Mrs. Oriole
fixed her eyes on the great red, green
and white ingrain carpet, and admired it;
what she thought we know not, but when
she glanced at the hitching post under
the tree, she instantly descended from
high, waving branch, to lowly square
post, for exactly covering the top of the
same was a miniature carpet, a piece just
six by six inches which Patrick should
have left indoors; not having done so, he
laid it on the inviting post for safe-keeping.
That bit of wool fabric was very
valuable, it exactly filled a jog right by
the fireplace, in which, alas! ever after
was seen an ugly piece of oil cloth!</p>
<p>All summer long the club girls and
boys gazed with wonder at the gay nest
in the elm, hanging like a solitary blossom
among the leaves; their speculations
about it would fill a long chapter; but
after the birds were flown far to the south,
and the leaves were gone, that nest was
finally cut down and told its story: thread
by thread, just as pulled from the bit of
carpet, had been woven into a decoration
for the outer wall of that hanging house,
till a rude reproduction of the original
tiny rug was under the feet of the birdlings,
and over the heads of the boys.</p>
<p>The club held a special exhibition of
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
that nest, and at Thanksgiving time one
of the home-coming guests, who was an
enthusiastic kindergartener in the city,
persuaded those generous nature students
to let her take their treasure to the
poor children who seldom saw the commonest
kind of a hang-bird&rsquo;s nest, and
in that kindergarten it may be seen today.</p>
<p>Another entry in the club book was
this: &ldquo;Birds building on the ground, especially
Vesper Sparrows, locate if possible
where they have a fine outlook, and
give great attention to the arrangement
of the front yard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was discovered when Emily Clymer
took her small brother Jo up in the
&ldquo;side hill pasture&rdquo; to see the finest mountain
view in all the county, and to find
wild strawberries; while picking the berries
they found what was afterward called
the juniper house; this was a Vesper
Sparrow&rsquo;s home, roofed by green growing
juniper.</p>
<p>Everybody knows that the prophet Elijah
could never have sat and wept under
a New England juniper tree; no tree is
less high or more nearly horizontal than
this; in fact, we call it a bush&mdash;where it
is big&mdash;this one was not larger than Emily
Clymer&rsquo;s two hands, and growing
straight out from descending ground, it
formed a flat, green roof to the Sparrow
homestead; then, while my lady sat upon
her nest, she looked out of her tiny front
door, across a gently sloping lawn, upon
a whole range of mountains. But most
remarkable of all were the ornamental
shade trees, for just ten inches from the
door, on either side, waved two big
brakes, symmetrical in size and shape;
they gracefully arched across the entrance,
and were to the Sparrow domicile
as the giant elms to the big Clymer homestead.
A sketch of this beautiful residence
was made by a member of the club&mdash;for
cameras were not common in Cloverdale
then&mdash;the picture cannot be
taken from the club book, but I think we
can see it all with our mind&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>Here is one of the most astounding
statements in that book of many observations:
&ldquo;Some Phoebes are like the
Golden Eagle in three ways&mdash;first, they
build on rocky and inaccessible cliffs,
second, they build in the same place for
one hundred years; and, third, when the
young are big enough to fly, they know
how, and just go up without any practicing.&rdquo;
All this can be proved to any one
who will go in nesting time to a cliff overhanging
the river just below Cloverdale,
and who will accept the testimony of
some of the most reliable and respectable
men who have honored that place in the
past century.</p>
<p>You must go in a boat and hug the
shore; of course you need a member of
the club for guide; at an unexpected moment
you are told to look over your head,
and there, glued to a shelf of rock so
small as to be entirely covered by the
same, is the nest! No porch, or even
doorstep, beyond its wall&mdash;an overhanging
roof of rock above, a shoreless expanse
of water below; now, if some one
can keep the boat steady, and you have
the nerve to stand at the highest point of
the bow, then by reaching over your head
you can gently touch some fuzzy bits of
life in the nest. Now you know the first
and last of the facts recorded are correct:
there is the nest on the inaccessible cliff;
there are the birds, and if they did not fly
up and out into the world the first time
they stood on the edge of the nest, would
they not be in the dark water below, instead
of coming back to the old home for
a hundred years?</p>
<p>The evidence of successive occupation
for a century is this: The present family
of Walkers&mdash;father and children&mdash;have
watched that nest, never finding it empty
a summer for twenty years. Old Deacon
Walker, grandfather of our club members&mdash;who,
of course, initiated their father&mdash;proved
that Phoebes had hatched in
the cliff nest during eighty years previous,
in this wise: After he had stood
guard forty years, as the deacon loved to
relate, didn&rsquo;t his Uncle Israel&mdash;who had
been spending just those two-score years
in the South&mdash;come home one spring
evening, and the very next morning that
ancient worthy demanded a boat and a
boy to take him under the old Phoebe&rsquo;s
nest on the ledge, which he affirmed had
never been without tenants during the
forty years before he left Cloverdale?</p>
<p>So there are the figures and facts showing
how not only the nest, but bird love
and bird lore had come down through the
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
century, and with such an inheritance, no
wonder the Walkers are on the best of
terms with feathered folk, or that they,
with their confidential friends, the Clymers,
are still adding to their bird book
things not generally known.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<h2 id="c6">A GOLDEN EAGLE.</h2>
<p>In January, 1900, I had given me a
Golden Eagle. He had been picked up in
a stunned condition in the foot-hills, having
received a shock from the electric
wires, on which he had probably alighted
for a moment or struck in his flight.
There is an electric power-house in the
Sierras opposite Fresno, from which pole
lines carry the strong current down to be
used for power and light in the valley,
and this was by no means the first record
of eagles and other large birds being
stunned or killed by them.</p>
<p>The person who found him had
brought him down with the idea of having
him stuffed, but as he showed a good
deal of life, I begged to keep him alive,
and he was handed over to me. He was
evidently a young bird of the previous
season, though nearly full grown. From
tip to tip of his wings he was over five
feet, and his wonderful black talons measured
one and one-half to two inches beyond
the feathers. His legs were handsomely
feathered down to the claws, and
his proud head, with its strong beak,
large, piercing eyes, and red and yellow-brown
feathers, was a thing of beauty.
The rest of his body was dark, almost
black, with the exception of three or four
white diamonds showing on the upper
tail feathers.</p>
<p>I kept him in a big box open on one
side. When I first brought him home
and had put him into the box, a neighbor&rsquo;s
poodle came sniffing around for the
meat I had brought for the eagle. He
was on the back side of the box, and so
could not see that there was anything in
it, nor did he hear anything, but all at
once the scent of the bird must have
struck his nostrils, for with a squall of
fear he disappeared from the yard and
never afterward would venture near the
cage.</p>
<p>During the time I kept the eagle,
some two months, he never showed any
desire to attack me, though his claws
would have gone through my hand like a
knife, nor did he display any fear of me.
He never made any attempt to get out
while anyone was in sight of him, nor did
I catch him in any such attempt, but
sometimes at night I would hear him, and
every morning his wings, beak and feathers
showed he never gave up the hope of
getting free.</p>
<p>I never fed him to the full extent of his
capacity, but gave him from a pound to
a pound and a half of meat daily at noon,
which he devoured in a very short time,
sticking his claws through the toughest
beef and tearing it like ribbons with his
beak. It was wonderful to see how clean
he could pick a bone with his clumsy-looking
great beak. I never knew him to
touch any kind of food but raw meat.
When anything was handed in to him, no
matter how high up, he never accepted it
in his bill, but struck at it with a lightning-like
movement of his claws, scarcely
ever missing it.</p>
<p>One day he snapped in two one of the
bars across his cage, pried off another
and got out. I was telephoned that my
eagle was out, and hurried home to find
all the children in the neighborhood
blockaded indoors. The eagle was
perched on the grape-arbor easily surveying
the lay of things. A cat had crawled
into the wood-pile and under the doorsteps
the venerable cock of the yard was
congratulating himself on his safety, but
feeling rather undignified. I procured a
rope and took my first lessons in lassoing.
The eagle had been so closely confined
that he had not been able to gain the
full use of his wings, and so could only
run or flutter a few feet from the ground.
I finally recaptured him and brought him
back. He showed no fear and offered little
resistance.</p>
<p>About the middle of March the weather
became very hot, and it was really
cruel to keep the bird penned up in such
close quarters in such weather, so I took
him out to the plains and set him free.
He could not use his wings much, and it
is very doubtful if he escaped the shotgun
or rifle of some predatory small boy,
but it was the best I could do for him.
He was a beautiful specimen of a bird,
and I only wish I could have kept him.</p>

<br />(Histrionicus histrionicus.)
<br />&frac12; Life-size.
<br /><span class="small">FROM COL. CHI. ACAD. SCIENCES.</span></p></div>

<h2 id="c7">THE HARLEQUIN DUCK.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Histrionicus histrionicus</i>.)</span></h2>
<p>The Harlequin Duck is the sole representative
of the genus to which it belongs.
The generic and the specific
names (Histrionicus), which unfortunately
the strict rules of scientific naming
require in the case of this bird to be the
same, are from the Latin word meaning
harlequin. This word, meaning a buffoon,
is especially appropriate, for the
arrangement of the colors on its head,
neck and back give the bird a peculiar
appearance, especially during the mating
season. At this time, too, the drollery
of their actions is very noticeable.</p>
<p>Harlequin is not the only name by
which this bird is known. In the New
England States and northward along the
Atlantic coast it is frequently called the
&ldquo;Lord and Lady,&rdquo; because of the white
crescents and spots of its plumage and
the proud bearing of the male. It is also
called the Rock Duck, the Mountain
Duck and the Squealer.</p>
<p>Its range covers the northern portion
of North America, Europe and Asia. &ldquo;It
is not common wherever found. In many
parts of the Old World it is only a rare
or occasional visitor; this is the case in
Great Britain, France and Germany.&rdquo; In
the United States, during the winter, it
passes southward into Illinois, Missouri
and California. It breeds only in the
northern part of its range.</p>
<p>It is a mountain duck and &ldquo;frequents
swiftly running streams, where it delights
to sport among the eddies below
water falls or in the brawling rapids.&rdquo; It
is not only an adept in the art of swimming
and diving, but it also flies swiftly
and to a great height. During the winter
it frequents northern sea coasts and
exhibits the characteristics of other sea
ducks, and is occasionally found far out
at sea. It is known that the Harlequin
will lead a solitary life, and it is sometimes
observed in pairs or even alone on
streams of remote and unfrequented localities.</p>
<p>The sexes vary greatly. While the
male, which is the sex of the bird of our
illustration, is brightly colored, the female
is much more somber. The young
resemble the adult female.</p>
<p>The food of the Harlequin consists almost
entirely of the parts of aquatic
plants and the smaller crustaceans and
mollusks. The food is obtained by diving,
frequently through several feet of
water. Mr. Chapman tells us that the
sea ducks in diving to obtain food, will
&ldquo;sometimes descend one hundred and
fifty feet or more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Its nest, though usually placed on the
ground, is sometimes built in the hollow
of a tree or a hollow stump, though always
near a body of water. The nest is
usually a simple structure made of the
stems of water plants, twigs and grass
thickly lined with the downy feathers
from the breast of the duck. The eggs
are occasionally laid on the grass, and no
effort is made to build a nest. The female
thoroughly covers the eggs when
she leaves the nest.</p>
<p>The number of eggs varies from six to
eight, though ten have been recorded.
They are of a &ldquo;yellowish buff or greenish
yellow&rdquo; color.</p>
<p>This duck is considered an excellent
food and is much sought for by the natives
of those regions which it frequents.</p>

<h2 id="c8">AN ORCHARD BIRD-WAY.</h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;A rodless Walton of the brooks,</p>
<p class="t0">A bloodless sportsman I;</p>
<p class="t0">I hunt for the thoughts that throng the woods,</p>
<p class="t0">The dreams that haunt the sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="lr">&mdash;<i>Samuel Walter Foss.</i></p>
</div>
<p>An isolated orchard certainly comes
very near being an inner sanctuary of
bird life. For some reason or other, the
gnarled old trees and matted June grass
touch either the practical or artistic
sense of bird nature very closely, and appeal
strongly to many a bird heart, for
therein do congregate all sorts and conditions
of feathered life. Probably it is
an exceptional feeding-ground, for the
curled and misshapen leaves testify to
the abundance of the hairy caterpillar and
leaf-worm supply, which proves such delectable
tidbit to the bird palate. When
I see the birds feasting upon these unsavory
looking morsels, I can but wonder
at the unregenerate farmer who so loudly
decries the bird as a fruit-destroyer, when
a few hours&rsquo; observation will teach him
that to one cherry stolen there are a
hundred tree destroyers gobbled up, and
a thousand weed seeds devoured. It is
Wilson Flagg who so curtly says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact, not yet understood in America,
that the birds which are the most mischievous
as consumers of fruit are the
most useful as destroyers of insects, is
well known by all the farmers of Europe;
and while we destroy the birds to save the
fruit, and sometimes cut down the fruit
trees to starve the birds, the Europeans
more wisely plant them for their sustenance
and accommodation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our orchard is surrounded by a fence
of weather-stained chestnut rails, whose
punctured surface has been the scene of
many a worm tragedy resulting in the
survival of the fittest. We enter through
a pair of lichen-covered bars, grey-tinted
and sobered by age. How far less picturesque
is our field and hedgerow when inclosed
by that inhuman human invention,
a barbed-wire fence, and trim swing gate.
To be neat and up to date, is never to be
picturesque, and seldom to be artistic.
But our quiet entrance into the orchard
has caused something of a disturbance
among the inhabitants, if no great alarm.
Fluttering hastily to a convenient tree
top goes a dainty red-eyed vireo, who
seems to me to have more of a grey than
olive gleam to his shining back. As he
alights upon the topmost bough&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;A bird&rsquo;s bright gleam on me he bent,</p>
<p class="t0">A bird&rsquo;s glance, fearless, yet discreet,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>but to show that he is in no way seriously
alarmed he flings down to us some sweet
notes of liquid song. It is Wilson Flagg,
I believe, that has dubbed him the
Preacher, but to me he seems more correctly
termed the Lover, for I can but interpret
his accentuated notes into &ldquo;Sweet
Spirit, Sweet&mdash;Sweet&mdash;Spirit,&rdquo; a continuous
cry, as it were, of loving eulogy to
the devoted little wife who is so carefully
hidden in her pocket nest in a distant
thorn tree. But all of this time we understand
his clever machinations, as he carefully
leads us in an opposite direction by
his song allurements. He flits from tree
to tree with a naive turn and flutter, keeping
upon us all the time, an eye alert and
keen, until he deems us at a safe distance
enough to be left to our own clumsy device,
when, with a quick turn, he wheels
backward to the starting-point, and we
hear a triumphant praise call to the beloved
&ldquo;Sweet Spirit.&rdquo; Near a corner of
the old orchard where there are great
bunches of Elder and Sumach, we hear
vehemently stitching, a busy little Maryland
yellow throat, doing up his summer
song work with an energetic &ldquo;Stitch-a-wiggle,
Stitch-a-wiggle, Stitch-a-wiggle,
stitch &rsquo;em,&rdquo; the &ldquo;stitch &rsquo;em&rdquo; brought out
with such emphatic force that it seems
the last satisfactory utterance of a work
accomplished. His pert vivacity has been
most delightfully illustrated by Ernest
Seton-Thompson, in Frank Chapman&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Bird Life,&rdquo; and I am sure the snap-shot
caught him on his last accentuated &ldquo;stitch
&rsquo;em.&rdquo; Dr. Abbot tells us that these busy
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
little people usually build their nests in
the skunk cabbage plants, indicating that
they must have an abnormal odor sense,
but perhaps they allow their sense of safety
to overcome their sense of smell. However,
this pair of yellow-throats have
built instead, among some thickly matted
Elders, just above the ground.</p>
<p>Another fact that favors our orchard
in bird minds, is its close proximity to a
thickly foliaged ravine which affords such
delightful security to feathered people.
It is also a charming background for
our sunny orchard, filled in below, as it
is, with tall, ghostly stalks of black cohosh
gleaming white in the shadows.</p>
<p>Near by, upon a bit of high ground,
quivers a group of prim American aspens,
the pale green of their bark gleaming
against the dark shadows of a hemlock
hedge. As we look at them, not a
leaf is in motion, when all of a sudden one
little leaf begins to gesticulate frantically,
throwing itself about with violent wildness,
then another leaf catches the enthusiasm
of the soft summer air, then another,
and another until all of the trees
are a mass of gesticulating, seething little
serrated atoms, for all the world like a
congregation of human beings, vociferating,
demonstrating, or contradicting
some poor little human leaf that has dared
to be moved by some passing thought in
advance of his fellow kind. Darting
through the quivering foliage comes a
gleam of fire, which resolves itself into a
scarlet tanager who calls to us, &ldquo;look-see,&rdquo;
demanding our attention to his
bright beauty, remembering possibly that
his brilliant coloring is but a thing of
short duration, for too soon will come
winter and plain clothes. Perched upon
a fence rail, but somewhat out of place
in this shady corner, sits a blatant
meadow lark, about whose golden breast
is hung a gleaming neck chain and locket
of shining black feathers, of which, from
the pert poise of his head, we deem him
justly proud, and he is at least a conspicuous
spot of color against the green
of the hillside. He eyes us impertinently
as he inconsistently but musically calls to
us, &ldquo;You-can&rsquo;t-see-me, You-can&rsquo;t-see-me,&rdquo;
in the face of the most contradictory
evidence of his own conspicuousness,
varying his song to &ldquo;Erie-lake-Erie,&rdquo;
with every other breath. As a child I
used to wonder who taught him the name
of the great lake on whose borders he
makes his summer home. But to other
people, other interpretations, for to
Neltje Blanchan he says &ldquo;Spring-o&rsquo;-the-year,
spring-o&rsquo;-the-year,&rdquo; and to Frank
Chapman his song is a bar of high, trilling
notes. Sing on, you wary warbler,
for we have not time to search out your
carefully hidden nest among the timothy
grasses of the distant meadow, for we
know that it would be like looking for the
pearl in the oyster, so carefully is it concealed
among the dried grasses, but which
snakes and field mice depredate so effectually.
In the distant valley we hear the
soft echo of the Italian liquids of the
wood thrush&rsquo;s &ldquo;A-o-le-le, a-oa-o-le.&rdquo; Shy
little songster, who so sweetly trills to
us long after his feathered kind have
tucked their busy little bills away in soft
wings. Across the orchard comes the romantic
&ldquo;Coo-coo-coo-coo,&rdquo; sometimes
interpreted into &ldquo;I-thou-thou-thou,&rdquo; of
the purple plumaged mourning dove,
starting out on a high minor and softly
falling to a low contralto. There are no
more delightful representatives of romantic
bird love, than these birds illustrate.
More frequently than in any other species
you see the devoted pair going about together,
on the telegraph wire, on the tree
top, on the wing, always together, undulating
their graceful necks with marked
devotion. Many a bird lover has criticised
Mr. Dove for his remarkable fondness
for a lady who is a so decidedly slack
housekeeper, and who is satisfied with so
shiftless a nest in which to deposit the
two white eggs, for the few carelessly
thrown together sticks can prove anything
but a bed of down to the tender bird
babies. However, perhaps these romantic
birds consider that &ldquo;love is enough&rdquo;
as they follow Le Gallienne&rsquo;s refrain of:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The bird of life is singing on the bough,</p>
<p class="t0">His two eternal notes of &lsquo;I and Thou&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Oh, hearken well, for soon the song sings through</p>
<p class="t0">And would we hear it, we must hear it now.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c9">THE CANADA GROUSE.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Dendragapus canadensis</i>.)</span></h2>
<p>The Canada Grouse, also called the
Spruce Partridge, frequents the evergreen
forests and swamps and the
shrubby areas of British America east of
the Rocky Mountains, and in Alaska it is
a resident of the Pacific coast. In its
southern flights it seldom passes beyond
the latitude of the northern portion of
New England and Minnesota.</p>
<p>This bird is an interesting member of
the bird family Tetraonidae, which also
includes the birds variously called bob-white,
quail and partridge, the ptarmigans
and the prairie hen. The family includes
about two hundred species, about
one-half of which belong to the Old
World. There are twenty-five distinct
species of the subfamily of grouse. These
are practically confined to the higher latitudes
of the northern hemisphere and
are strictly speaking non-migratory. In
fact, nearly all the birds of this family are
resident throughout the year in the localities
where they are found.</p>
<p>They are terrestrial in their habits, and
when frightened they usually depend on
hiding in places where their dull colors
will least attract attention, but they will,
occasionally, fly into trees when flushed.</p>
<p>The Canada Grouse, like all the related
species, is a bird of rapid flight. The
feathers of their small wings are stiff,
causing a whirring sound during flight.
The male during the mating season gives
a great deal of attention to his appearance.
He is quite black in general color
and more or less barred with white underneath
and above with gray or reddish
brown. The female is not quite as large
as the male, and is not as dark in color.
Above the eye of the male there is a small
area of bare skin, which is a bright vermilion
color.</p>
<p>These gentle and retiring birds mate
in the early spring and remain together
through the breeding season. Captain
Bendire states that he has good reason
for believing that the mating may last for
more than one season, as he has frequently
found a pair, in the depth of winter,
when no other individuals of the same
species were near. The nest, consisting
of loosely arranged blades of grass and a
few stalks and twigs, is built by the hen
on a slight elevation of ground, usually
under the low branches of a spruce tree.</p>
<p>The number of eggs varies greatly.
Mr. Ridgway says that they vary in number
from nine to sixteen. The eggs also
vary greatly in color from a pale, creamy
buff through various shades to brownish
buff, and are irregularly spotted with a
deeper brown, though occasionally they
are spotless.</p>
<p>During the spring and summer months
the food of the Canada Grouse consists
very largely of the berries of plants belonging
to the Heath family, such as the
blueberry, the huckleberry and the bearberry,
as well as the tender buds of the
spruce. In the winter it feeds almost entirely
on these buds, and the needle-like
leaves of the spruce, the fir or the tamarack
trees. At times they seem to show
a preference for certain trees, and will
nearly strip the foliage from them.</p>
<p>As a food for man their flesh is far
from satisfactory. It is dark-colored and
strongly flavored with the odor of their
natural food. However, certain Indian
tribes are said to relish them and hunt
them extensively.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>Mr. Bishop, in &ldquo;Forest and Stream,&rdquo;
relates the following very interesting account
of the strutting of the male Canada
Grouse while in captivity. He says, &ldquo;I
will describe as nearly as I can his conduct
and attitude while strutting: The
tail stands almost erect, the wings are
slightly raised from the body and a little
drooped, the head is still well up, and the
feathers of breast and throat are raised
and standing out in regular rows, which
press the feathers of the nape and hind
neck well back, forming a smooth kind
of cape on the back of the neck. This
smooth cape contrasts beautifully with
the ruffled black and white feathers of
the throat and fore breast. The red comb
over each eye is enlarged until the two
nearly meet over the top of the head.
This comb the bird is able to enlarge or
reduce at will, and while he is strutting
the expanded tail is moved from side to
side. The two center feathers do not
move, but each side expands and contracts
alternately with each step the bird
walks. The movement of the tail produces
a peculiar rustling, like that of silk.
This attitude gives him a very dignified
and even conceited air. He tries to attract
attention in every possible way, by
flying from the ground up on a perch, and
back to the ground, making all the noise
he can in so doing. Then he will thump
some hard substance with his bill. I have
had him fly up on my shoulder and thump
my collar. At this season he is very bold,
and will scarcely keep enough out of the
way to avoid being stepped on. He will
sometimes sit with his breast almost
touching the earth, his feathers erect as
in strutting, and making peculiar nodding
and circular motions of the head
from side to side; he will remain in this
position two or three minutes at a time.
He is a most beautiful bird, and shows
by his actions that he is perfectly aware
of the fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There seems to be a diversity of opinion
regarding the method followed by
this grouse to produce the drumming
sound. Mr. Everett Smith, as quoted by
Captain Bendire, says, &ldquo;The Canada
Grouse performs its drumming upon the
trunk of a standing tree of rather small
size, preferably one that is inclined from
the perpendicular, and in the following
manner: Commencing near the base of
the tree selected, the bird flutters upward
with somewhat slow progress, but rapidly
beating wings, which produce the
drumming sound. Having thus ascended
fifteen or twenty feet it glides
quietly on the wing to the ground
and repeats the maneuver.&rdquo; According
to this and other authorities
a tree, usually spruce, having a diameter
of about six inches and inclining at an
angle of about fifteen degrees, is selected.
Frequently these trees are used so extensively
and for so long a time that the
bark on the upper side will be much
worn. Other authorities, and among
them Indians, who live in the regions frequented
by this grouse, claim that the
drumming is produced while flying from
the branches of a tree to the ground, repeating
the operation several times in
succession. Another authority describes
the drumming of the male as follows,
&ldquo;After strutting back and forth for a few
minutes, the male flew straight up, as
high as the surrounding trees, about
fourteen feet; here he remained stationary
an instant, and while on suspended
wing did the drumming with the wings,
resembling distant thunder, meanwhile
dropping down slowly to the spot from
where he started, to repeat the same thing
over and over again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Canada Grouse is easily domesticated
and would make an interesting and
amiable bird pet, because of their peculiar
habits.</p>

<h2 id="c10">DO PLANTS HAVE INSTINCT.</h2>
<p>Instinct has been defined as a spontaneous
impulse, especially in the lower
animals&mdash;that moves them, without reasoning,
toward actions that are essential
to their existence, preservation and development.
Instinct, imbedded in their
organic structure, is the guide of animal
life as reason is the guide of rational life.
Instinct is said to be incapable of development
and progress.</p>
<p>It is instinct that guides the wild goose
in his long flight to meet the changing
requirements of food and nesting. It is
instinct that enables the carrier pigeon,
though taken hoodwinked and by night
to distant points, to wing his way unerringly
homeward. Instinct leads the
thrifty squirrel to stock his larder with
nuts in anticipation of the period that
must pass ere nuts are ripe again, and
teaches him to destroy the embryo plant
by biting out the germ so that his chestnuts
will not sprout and thus be spoiled
for food. The same wonderful power enables
the bee to build her comb upon the
strictest mathematical principles so as to
obtain the greatest storage capacity and
strength of structure with smallest consumption
of wax, and then to store it with
one of the most perfect and concentrated
of foods. These and many other well-known
cases of animal instinct will occur
to the reader, but the object of this article
is to mention a few phenomena of plant
life, whereby they make, what we should
designate in human beings, an intelligent
adjustment to environment or provision
for their future life and development.</p>
<p>As autumn approaches, even before
Jack Frost strikes the first rude signal
for winter quarters for insect and plant,
or the wintry blasts compel the trees to
furl sail and scud under bare poles, the
forest trees begin to prepare for unfavorable
conditions by forming and securely
tucking away the bud that is next year to
develop into leaf and flower. Before the
leaf drops off, a substantial layer of cork
is made to close up the pores through
which the sap had so freely flowed during
the growing season.</p>
<p>My older readers know, of course, that
the green color of the leaf is due to the
numerous corpuscles of chlorophyll
which fill the cells. This same chlorophyll
has an important mission to fulfill.
These little green bodies are the only real
food-making machines in nature. Upon
the product of these tiny mills all animate
nature depends for food. Their motive
power is light, and their raw material the
inorganic fluids absorbed by the roots
from the soil, and their product is sugars
and starches. It will be seen that chlorophyll
is one of the most precious, as well
as one of the rarest of substances, for
while there may appear a great quantity
it is superficial, never entering deeply
into the substance of the plant.</p>
<p>The trees, by a sort of instinct, shall
we say, withdraw their cohorts of green-liveried
workers from the front as autumn
approaches and deck themselves in
the more gaudy but less wholesome colors
of declining life. It is after the chlorophyll
is withdrawn that the layer of
cork is formed. The sturdy oak usually
holds his brown leaves until they are
whipped off by the wind.</p>
<p>The plants have been using light as a
motive power for ages, while man, with
his much-vaunted reason, is just beginning
to utilize the kindred force, electricity,
in arts and sciences. Man makes
light draw a few pictures in sombre black
and white, while nature flings broadcast
landscape and life scenes in varied tints
and shades.</p>
<p>In the process of photosynthesis much
more energy is received than is necessary
to run the machinery, so the plant, with
commendable frugality, uses it in laying
on what botanists call warming-up colors.
If you will notice the peach twigs the next
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
time you take a walk, you will see that
the more tender shoots and the buds are
decked in rich reds and browns. That
this is not for mere ornament may be
practically demonstrated by wrapping the
bulbs of two similar thermometers, the
one with a green leaf, the other with a
brown or red leaf, say of begonia or beet.
Then put the two in the sunlight and you
will soon find a difference of from six to
ten degrees in favor of the warming-up
color. Speaking of buds, have you examined
the horse chestnut bud? It is
prepared for the winter in the most substantial
manner. The future leaf is first
wrapped in a quantity of finest silky wool,
then a number of tough light green cases
are put on, and this is followed by compact
brown scales neatly overlapping,
with a complete coating of wax, so that
the interior is effectively protected from
the cold and moisture. The use of the
warming-up colors is quite common with
plants.</p>
<p>In the far north the same plant that requires
the whole long growing season to
mature its seed, will crowd the whole process
into a few weeks. It will suspend
growth and all other processes, or run
them on short time and devote itself almost
entirely to producing seed, and the
seed itself will have much thicker shell.</p>
<p>I was interested last autumn in the pathetic
struggle of a humble little Chenopodium
album that had started life late
and under unfavorable circumstances. It
came up in September under the north
piazza near the beaten foot path; close up
to the building. I was first attracted by
the fact that, though it was not over a
foot high, it had bloomed and was making
seed at a desperate rate, while its
sisters earlier in the season reached several
feet in height before blooming. But,
alas! for the vanity of the poor little creature,
the cold weather during the Christmas
holidays came on, and the steam being
shut off, the side of the building grew
cold and my struggling little friend was
frozen, and soon its lifeless remains were
the sport and derision of the rude January
winds. I pitied the poor little vagabond
despite the bad record of her family.
Indeed plants, like people, must suffer
sometimes because of an evil ancestry.
In this case I was touched by the pathos
of the situation, and really hoped the pertinacious
little wretch might proudly
scatter her well-matured seed upon the
hard-beaten path as an inspiration to the
many boys that passed daily, grumbling
because of the hardness of their lot. But
the only moral I can now draw is the foolishness
of delaying in the right start.</p>
<p>Sometimes the supply of light-energy
is so great that the little chlorophyll machines
cannot use it in their legitimate
work, nor does the plant use it in preparing
the warming-up color. Then the disc-shaped
corpuscles turn their edges instead
of their flat surfaces to the light, or
sometimes move deeper down into the
leaf. In some cases the leaf itself turns
edgewise instead of broadside to the sun.</p>
<p>There are many plants so constituted
that they cannot live from year to year in
our northern climate, and they must
make some provision for preserving their
species, and right cunningly do they do
this. At a certain period of its growth the
potato, for example, puts its starch-making
machinery to work on full time, and
hurries the starch down below the surface
of the ground, and stores it up in what
we call a tuber. These tubers have stored
in them a number of embryo potato
plants, whose lack-luster eyes we see
peeping out on all sides. When the time
for growth comes, the young plant starts
with a reserve-food supply sufficient to
keep it growing for some time. We have
all noticed, no doubt, how large a plant
will grow from a potato, even in a comparatively
dark cellar. We must not
think that tuber-bearing vines and nut-producing
trees are actuated entirely by
philanthropic motives. Each nut is the
young tree sent forth with his patrimony
strapped to his back, ready to make a
good start in the world as soon as the favorable
time comes.</p>
<p>There are many devices for spending
the winter that limits of time and space
will prevent me writing about. Many of
them more curious than the simple examples
I have cited.</p>
<p>Plants are themselves generally unable
to move from their fixed positions, so if
they are to become prominent in the
world they must send out their children&mdash;and
many and ingenious are their devices
for accomplishing this end. Most of my
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
readers are familiar with the parachutes
of the silk weed, dandelion and various
members of the Compositae family. How
they sail through the air. A walk through
the autumn forests will make one the unconscious,
perhaps unwilling, carrier of
numerous Spanish needles, stick tights,
burrs and seeds of various plants who
have taught their children to steal rides in
all sorts of provoking ways. I imagine
the wicked old mother laughs as her ugly
baby clings to your clothing, sure of a
safe ride to a more favorable place for
growing. Many plants achieve the same
end in a more pleasant way. They produce
fruits and berries so luscious that
some bird or animal will carry it some
distance for the sake of the pulp. Man
himself, philanthropist as he is, when he
finds that a plant has produced a luscious
fruit or palatable seed, will help the distribution
and growth, and bring his superior
intelligence to the assistance of the
plant&rsquo;s slow instinct to improve its product.
A book might be written upon the
methods of seed dissemination. In fact,
there is a very interesting book upon the
subject.</p>
<p>We will just notice briefly the marvelous
adaptation of plants to their environment.
In the dry plains of Arizona grows
a peculiar thick-leaved, stunted, cactus-like
plant, suited to withstand the drouth.
In the forests of Central South America
a great vine climbs to the tops of the tallest
trees and there flaunts its gay colors to
the breeze. In Damara Land, southwest
tropical Africa, upon a small upland section,
and nowhere else in the world,
grows the marvelous Welwitschia mirabilis,
with no real leaves, but with its two
cotyledons, persistent and growing to
enormous length, living a century and acquiring
a great trunk, the flower-stalk
growing up from the bare trunk while the
two great leaves, if I may so designate
them, whip about in the breezes for a century
without change, except as they fray
out at the ends. These three so dissimilar
plants all had a common, not so remote,
ancestor, but have grown so unlike in
their effort to adapt themselves to their
environment, that no casual observer
would suspect they were akin.</p>
<p>There is so much to say about the wonderful
intelligence displayed by plants in
their various activities, that a volume
could not do the subject justice. We
started with the question, Do plants have
instinct? We end with the question,
Have they?</p>

<h2 id="c12">THE DOVEKIE.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Alle alle.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>This little bird, often called the Sea
Dove, belongs to the family of auks
(Alcid&aelig;). The range of the Dovekie is
quite limited. While the marble murrelet,
a related bird, is confined to the
northern Pacific coast of North America,
this little bird frequents only the &ldquo;coast
and islands of the north Atlantic and
eastern Arctic Oceans; in North America
south in winter to New Jersey.&rdquo; It
breeds only in the northern part of its
range. It has been observed as far
west as the state of Michigan, but its
appearance there was, without doubt,
accidental, for it prefers the wild sea
coast, where the storm and waves bring
to it an abundant supply of food.</p>
<p>It is said to be a rare visitor on the
coasts of the British Islands and it has
been reported as common as far to the
northward as Spitzbergen. In Greenland,
where it is commonly found a
close companion of the black-billed
auk, the native Greenlanders call the
Dovekie the Ice Bird, as they consider
it a harbinger of ice.</p>
<p>Though the wings of the Dovekie are
small in proportion to the size of its
body it flies well and rapidly. One
writer states that it will move its wings
almost as rapidly as will a humming-bird.
It is an expert diver and while
swimming or resting on the water it
will frequently dip its bill into the
water. On the land it is much more
graceful and walks better than nearly
all the other members of the family
of auks.</p>
<p>It feeds chiefly on small fish, crustacea
and mollusks and will become very
fat during a prolonged stormy season
when the waves wash up an abundant
supply of crabs and fish.</p>
<p>The Dovekie builds a simple nest
usually in the crevices of rocky cliffs
bordering the sea coast. It lays one or
two bluish white eggs which are about
the size of the pigeon&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Mr. Saunders in speaking of the habits
of the Dovekie says: &ldquo;On the approach
of a vessel this bird has a
peculiar way of splashing along the
surface of the water, as if unable to fly,
and then diving through the crest of an
advancing wave; it swims rather deep
and very much by the stern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dovekie is sometimes called a
little auk to distinguish it from the
larger species of the family. The flightless
great auk, which at one time was
common along the north Atlantic coast,
belongs to this family. No living representative
of the great auk has been
reported since the year 1842. Unable
to protect itself by flight it was ruthlessly
exterminated by the zeal of
hunters and fishermen who sought it
for food, for its feathers and for the oil
that could be extracted from its flesh.</p>

<h2 id="c14">THE SONG SPARROW&rsquo;S APPEAL.</h2>
<p>Naturalists tell us that of all creatures
below man, the largest animal brain in
proportion to the size of the body is found
in horses and song-birds. Whatever
sense beyond instinct the little creature of
whom we write may have had, something,
at least, told it that it could obtain
help at human hands.</p>
<p>A little sparrow the past season entered
the kitchen of one of our country
homes, and perched upon the window-sill
in evident distress. Its feathers were
ruffled, and its head ever and anon turned
curiously around and up, as if looking at
something out of the house and above
the window.</p>
<p>In and out it continued to hop, without
intermission, regardless of all offers
of food, until the shutters were closed at
twilight, and various were the surmises
as to the cause of its strange conduct.</p>
<p>Through the course of the following
day the same scene was enacted, without
any clue appearing as to the cause of its
distress.</p>
<p>At length, on the third morning, the
mute petition for aid still continuing, one
of the family, bethinking herself of the
bird&rsquo;s curious upturning of the head,
caught a new idea from it. Perhaps she
might have a nest in the ivy that encircled
the window, and something might
be amiss with its little household.</p>
<p>Going to the second story and looking
down, the cause of the trouble was at
once manifest. A thick limb of the ivy
had become loosened by the wind, and
fallen directly across the petitioner&rsquo;s nest.
It was too heavy for the bird to remove,
and offered an insuperable difficulty in
the way of her getting in to feed her
young&mdash;now almost lifeless.</p>
<p>The branch was quickly removed,
when the mother-bird, pausing only for
a brief inspection of her brood, was on
the wing in search of food. Her mate
soon joined her, and both were busy as
quick wings, worked by hearty good will,
could make them.</p>
<p>Once only did the mother pause in her
work&mdash;as if desirous to give expression
to her gratitude, she reappeared upon
the window-seat, and poured forth a
sweet and touching song, as of thankfulness
to her benefactors.</p>
<p>She returned three successive seasons,
to be noticed and fed at the same spot
where her acquaintance and familiarity
with man first commenced.</p>
<p>We will add another similar incident,
which is also absolutely true.</p>
<p>The correctness is vouched for by Mr.
George Babbitt, late captain on Gen.
Gresham&rsquo;s staff, of which he himself was
a witness.</p>
<p>During the fierce cannonading in one
of the battles of the Civil War, a small
bird came and perched upon the shoulder
of an artilleryman&mdash;the man designated,
we believe, as &ldquo;No. 1,&rdquo; whose duty it is
to force down the charge after the ammunition
is put in the gun. The piece
was a &ldquo;Napoleon,&rdquo; which makes a very
loud report, and the exact scene of this
occurrence was at a place called &ldquo;Nickajack.&rdquo;
The bird perched itself upon this
man&rsquo;s shoulder and could not be driven
from its position by the violent motions
of the gunner. When the piece was discharged,
the poor little thing would run
its beak and head up under the man&rsquo;s hair
at the back of the neck, and when the report
died away would resume its place
upon his shoulder. Captain Babbitt took
the bird in his hand, but when released it
immediately resumed its place on the
shoulder of the smoke-begrimed gunner.
The singular and touching scene was witnessed
by a large number of officers and
men. It may be a subject of curious inquiry,
what instinct led this bird to thus
place itself. Possibly, frightened at the
violent commotion caused by the battle,
and not knowing how to escape or where
to go, some instinct led it to throw itself
upon the gunner as a protector. But,
whatever the cause, the incident was a
most beautiful and pleasing one to all
who witnessed it.</p>

<h2 id="c15">THE WITCH IN THE CREAM.
<br /><span class="small">A TRUE STORY.</span></h2>
<p>The old stone farm-house in which my
grandmother lived had beneath it what
I thought a very interesting cellar. The
floor was plastered and whitewashed like
the walls, to ensure the place from rats
and other intruders, as well as to keep it
cool. From the walls, flat stones projected,
serving as shelves on which the butter
and milk were kept. For years the milk
had had a shelf to itself near the window.</p>
<p>One summer morning, while Grandma
and I were sitting on the porch waiting
for breakfast, the little colored servant
came to us with wide-open eyes, saying:
&ldquo;La, Missy, jes look at dis milk-pan!&rdquo;
We looked, and saw, to our disgust, that
the inside of the pan was covered with
sand and grime, while the milk, which
usually was coated with rich, thick cream,
was thin and poor. &ldquo;Why, Janey,&rdquo; said
Grandma, &ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t put milk away in a
pan like that, did you?&rdquo; &ldquo;La, no, Missy,&rdquo;
said Janey, &ldquo;nobody wouldn&rsquo;t nebber put
milk away in a dirty pan.&rdquo; &ldquo;This is very
strange,&rdquo; said Grandma. &ldquo;You will have
to throw the milk away, Janey, and be
especially careful to have the pan clean
this evening.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said Janey, &ldquo;I
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following morning, however, the
milk had to be thrown away again, as the
pan was in a worse condition than on the
preceding morning. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand
it,&rdquo; said Grandma. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be rats, nor
mice, for there is no way for them to
come in.&rdquo; &ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t climb into a
tin pan eight inches high, at any rate,&rdquo; I
said, &ldquo;and if they jumped in they would
drown.&rdquo; Janey shook her head knowingly
and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s witches, Missy, dat&rsquo;s
jes what it is.&rdquo; A light board was placed
over the milk that evening, but we found
that the marauder pushed it off in the
night. We felt that we must come to
Janey&rsquo;s conclusion about the witches, if
the mystery were not solved soon.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of the third day of
these experiences we were sitting on the
back porch with our sewing, both of us
half asleep, when chancing to look up I
saw a rat go scudding across the yard.
Straight to the cellar window he went,
and, approaching one corner, thrust his
nose under the sash. He gave a mighty
tug, pushed one paw under, and soon, by
pushing and pulling with nose and with
paws, he crept through the window.
From my position on the porch I could
see all that was happening in the cellar.
He jumped to the milk shelf, turned
around, raised himself on his forepaws,
and clasped the edge of the milk pan with
his hind ones.</p>
<p>He then threw his tail into the pan,
whisked it rapidly over the milk, coating
it with cream, and licked it. This he repeated
until he had a full meal, or at least
until he had skimmed all the cream.</p>
<p>He started homeward then, and I was
so much amazed that I didn&rsquo;t attempt to
stop him. On the following morning he
was caught in the steel trap set just inside

<h2 id="c16">THE BEAVER.</h2>
<p>The genus of Beavers (Castor) is apparently
represented by a single living
species. By some authorities the American
form is considered a distinct species
and is given the technical name Castor
canadensis, while the European form is
called Castor fiber. In external characteristics
the two resemble each other very
closely, and it is in the study of the structure
of the skeleton that the differences
appear. However, though there is this
diversity of opinion, it is sufficient for the
reader to look upon the two forms as
merely geographical races of the same
species, and that the Beaver is a native of
the greater part of the northern hemisphere.
Though its home covered this extensive
area, it has disappeared from the
larger number of localities that it once frequented.
Speaking of its range as a
whole, it may now be considered rare except
in certain isolated localities. This
extermination is due to the advance of
civilization upon its natural haunts, and
the commercial zeal that has stimulated
the hunter to greater efforts to effect its
capture. Within recent years the Beaver
was common in some of the Gulf States.
In 1876 it was reported as abundant in
Virginia. It is evident from an examination
of the numerous writings regarding
its distribution that the Beaver formerly
existed in great numbers not only in the
Atlantic States, but also to the westward
as far as the Pacific coast.</p>
<p>The Beaver is a member of that large
order of gnawing mammals called the
Rodentia, from the Latin word meaning
to gnaw. In this order are classed all
those animals that have those peculiar
long incisor teeth which are constantly
renewed by growth from the roots and
as constantly worn to a chisel edge, at the
outer end, by gnawing. Such animals are
squirrels, the gophers, the mice, the rats,
the muskrats, the porcupines, the hares
and the rabbits.</p>
<p>The habits of the Beaver are very interesting.
Several years are required before
its growth is fully attained, and it will increase
in size after the teeth are fully mature.
&ldquo;Two-year-old Beavers generally
weigh about thirty-five to forty pounds,
while very old ones occasionally attain a
weight of upwards of sixty. Morgan records
the capture of one which weighed
sixty-three pounds. The increase in the
size of the skull seems to continue nearly
through life; in old age the skull not only
acquires larger dimensions, but the
weight is relatively greater in consequence
of the increased thickness and
density of the bones. The ridges for the
attachment of muscles also become more
strongly developed in old age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The general color of the back of the
Beaver is a reddish brown. The shade
varies both with the seasons and with the
geographical location. Those found farther
to the northward are usually darker.
Albinos, either pure white, nearly white
or with white blotches, have been observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fur consists of an exceedingly
thick, flaky, woolly coat of silky softness
and a thin, long outer coat composed of
strong, stiff, shining hair, short on the
head and rear part of the back and over
two inches long on the rest of the body.&rdquo;
The tail, which is rounded at the base,
much flattened and very broad, bears
horny, dark-colored scales.</p>
<p>The fore legs are short and the feet are
unwebbed. The hind legs are much
stronger, the feet are fully webbed and
they, alone, are used, with the aid of the
tail, to propel the Beaver through the
water. In the water it is graceful in its
motions, but on the land, like nearly all
animals that are fitted for a partially
aquatic life, it is clumsy and awkward and
its motions are neither rapid nor uniform.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>Usually it is only in those districts that
are remote from the habitations of man
that the Beaver lives in colonies, consisting
of several families, and builds its
&ldquo;lodges.&rdquo; Nearer civilization it lives in
burrows or tunnels. In the building of
their homes, as well as in the storing of
a supply of food, the female is the most
active and is the practical builder, while
the male assists.</p>
<p>Brehm writes interestingly regarding
the Beaver. He says: &ldquo;After mature deliberation
the animals select a stream or
pool, the banks of which afford them ample
provender and seem specially adapted
for the construction of their &lsquo;lodges.&rsquo;
Those which live singly dwell in simple
subterranean burrows, after the manner
of otters; societies, which generally consist
of families, as a rule construct houses
and, if there should be a necessity for it,
dams, in order to hold back the water and
preserve it at a uniform height. Some of
these dams are from four hundred and
fifty to six hundred feet long, from six to
nine feet high, from twelve to eighteen
feet thick at the base and from three to six
feet at the top. They consist of logs varying
in size from the thickness of an arm to
that of a thigh and from three to six feet
long. One end of the log or stake is
thrust in the ground, the other stands upright
in the water; the logs are fastened
together by means of thin twigs and made
tight with reeds, mud and earth, in such a
way that one side presents a nearly vertical,
firm wall to the stream, while the
other side is sloped. From the ponds
rising above the dams, canals are constructed
to facilitate the carrying or floating
of the necessary construction materials
and food. Beavers do not forsake
a settlement they have founded unless the
direst necessity compels them to do so.
Beavers&rsquo; lodges, the origin of which dates
very far back, are often found in lonely
woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Beaver usually feeds upon the bark
of the younger branches of trees and
shrubs and upon their leaves. It will also
strip the older branches, in a very skillful
manner, and eat the inner tender portion
of the bark. During the fall and early
winter months they work constantly in
preparing and storing, in the neighborhood
of their lodges, the winter&rsquo;s supply
of food. &ldquo;Each cabin has its own magazine,
proportioned to the number of its inhabitants,
who have all a common right
to the store and never pillage their neighbors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The American Indians look upon the
Beaver with great respect. They believe
that it is possessed of a degree of intelligence
second only to that of man. Some
Indians even assert that it possesses an
immortal soul. Its sagacity is certainly
very strong and it will easily adapt itself
to changed environments. Unlike the
other rodents, it seems to reason before
acting and will build its habitations in the
form that the surrounding conditions demand
for the construction of the most
durable home.</p>
<p>The Beaver, especially when young, is
quite easily domesticated. Various
writers speak of finding tame Beavers in
Indian villages, where they seemed to be
perfectly at home and contented. They
were allowed full liberty. &ldquo;They seemed
to feel quite comfortable in the society of
the Indian women and children; they
grew restless in their absence and showed
much pleasure on their return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young, which number from two to
three, are born blind, but are covered
with fur. They usually obtain their sight
in from eight to ten days, and are then led
to the water by the mother.</p>
<p>Early in the nineteenth century Dr.
George Shaw wrote as follows regarding
the habits of the Beaver: &ldquo;They collect
in September their provisions of bark and
wood; after which they enjoy the fruits
of their labors, and taste the sweets of
domestic happiness. Knowing and loving
one another from habit, from the
pleasures and fatigues of a common
labor, each couple join not by chance, nor
by the pressing necessities of nature, but
unite from choice and from taste. They
pass together the autumn and the winter.
Perfectly satisfied with each other, they
never separate. At ease in their cabins,
they go not out but upon agreeable or
useful excursions, to bring in supplies of
fresh bark, which they prefer to what is
too dry or too much moistened with
water.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c19">SNAILS OF THE OCEAN.</h2>
<p>Many of my readers have doubtless
spent some of the vacation months at the
sea shore and have wandered over the
beach at low tide picking up shells and
other objects left by the receding ocean.
They have also, I am sure, peered into
the little pools of water left on the beach
and have watched with interest the captives
imprisoned therein, hermit crabs,
fiddler crabs, sea anemones, sea worms
and snail shells. It is with the latter that
the present article will deal.</p>
<p>The stretch of beach which is uncovered
twice a day by the receding of the
water is called &ldquo;between tides,&rdquo; and is inhabited
by a host of animate creatures,
chief among which are the mollusks.
The marine snails outnumber all of those
which we discussed in the last article, and
their shells are far more beautiful, those
found in the tropics having the most
gaudy colors imaginable. The animals
are formed on the same plan as those of
the fresh-water snails, although each family
has some peculiarity not shared by its
relatives. All live in the water and breathe
air through that medium by means of
gills, similar to the second class of fresh
water snails mentioned in the last number.
They are found in all parts of the world,
those of the tropics, however, being the
most brilliantly colored. While the majority
of species live either between tides
or near low water, there are not a few
which live in the abysses of the ocean,
and have been dredged from the bottom
of the sea at a depth of two thousand,
seven hundred and forty fathoms, or, to
put it more plainly, over three miles. The
average depth at which mollusks are
found in any number is about one thousand
fathoms. The variability of marine
snails is so great that we shall be
able to call attention to but a limited
number of typical forms.</p>
<p>Among the best known of the marine
snails are the Tritons, a family of mollusks
living in tropical seas. Their shells
are generally large and highly-colored
and variously ornamented with short
spines and knobs. One species, the Triton
tritonis, is among the largest of mollusks,
measuring eighteen inches in
length. One of the smaller Tritons is
pictured on the plate. Another shell familiar
to those who have visited Florida
is the Fasciolaria or banded snail, which
attains a length of three inches and is
very prettily banded and dashed with
color. A near relative of this species is
the giant banded shell (Fasciolaria gigantea),
which is the largest of all marine
snails, growing to a length of nearly two
feet. This species is found plentifully on
the southern Atlantic coast of the United
States, being particularly abundant
about the coral reefs of the Florida Keys.</p>
<p>A genus of mollusks with light horn
colored shells, and inhabiting the cold
waters of the Arctic seas, is the Buccinum,
or whelk. In various parts of Great
Britain it is known as &ldquo;buckie&rdquo; and &ldquo;mutlog.&rdquo;
The Buccinum delights to burrow
in the sand, like the moon shells (Natica),
and frequently nothing but the end of the
siphon can be seen, the latter protruding
from the sand to enable the water to enter
the animal to furnish the necessary
oxygen. The whelk is used economically,
both for food and bait. One ingenious
method of catching them is to fasten
a dead fish of good size in a wire basket
and to allow it to rest on the bottom for
a short time; when taken up it is covered
with large, fat whelks. This fishery
in Great Britain is fully as valuable as
our oyster fishery, the annual income
from this industry reaching to thousands
of pounds sterling. The animal is also
one of the principal baits used in cod
fishing. A related genus, the neptune
shells (Neptunea), is also eaten by the
poorer people and makes a good codfish
bait. The two kinds of whelk (Buccinum
and Neptunea), are termed, the first the
white whelk and the second the red or
almond whelk, probably on account of
the colors of the two shells. In the Shetland
Islands the red whelk is used as a
lamp, being suspended by strings from a
nail, the mouth placed uppermost and
filled with oil.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>The basket shells or dog-whelks are
among the most numerous in individuals
of all the marine snail shells, the common
black whelk (Nassa obsoleta) being the
most common of all the mollusks. The
writer has seen a mud flat at low water
literally paved with the shells of this snail,
there being millions of the little creatures
crawling about. The shells of this
family are frequently very handsome, being
latticed by the crossing of lateral and
longitudinal lines. They are mostly of
small size, scarcely exceeding an inch in
length, many of them being much under
these dimensions. The animal is very
rapid in movement and leaves a distinct
track in the mud, which will frequently
end at a little pellet of mud, which, upon
examination, will disclose the little animal
nicely concealed beneath.</p>
<p>The Nassas of France are very destructive
to the oyster beds of that nation,
an adult &ldquo;borer&rdquo; being able to perforate
the shell of a large oyster in a single
night. So numerous are these pests
that a single acre has yielded over a thousand
individuals. As a result of these
depredations the French oystermen carry
on a relentless war against the Nassa, destroying
thousands of animals annually.
With all this persecution the mollusk still
exists and even increases in numbers.
The dead shells of this genus are a favorite
home for the hermit crabs of small
size, and it is to be suspected sometimes
that other than dead shells are appropriated.
We fear that a sort of piracy is
resorted to by the hermit crab, resulting
in a kind of &ldquo;walk-the-plank&rdquo; end for the
mollusk, before the new tenant takes possession
of the &ldquo;home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the many varieties of tropical shells,
few exceed the Volutes, or bat shells, in
beauty or variety of coloration. They
are found in most parts of the world, although
strangely enough none are now
living in the seas of Europe, but they are
most abundant and more highly colored
in the tropics and subtropics. The animal
is carnivorous, and the long, fang-shaped
teeth are certainly suggestive of
predaceous habits. The shells are variously
colored, some being mottled, some
with zigzag or lightning-like markings,
while others have spirally arranged dots
and lines. One species (Voluta musica,
figured on the plate), has received its
name from a more or less fanciful resemblance
of the surface of the shell to a musical
staff, the spiral lines being grouped
in sets of four or five and the dots being
arranged as notes. In some specimens
this resemblance is quite close. The
smooth and polished shell of some volutes
is due to the fact that the greater
portion is covered by a reflected part of
the large foot.</p>
<p>On the sandy shores of subtropical
beaches certain graceful and polished animals
bury themselves from sight in the
sand. These are the olive shells (Oliva)
whose bright colors and highly polished
surfaces rival even the gaudy Volute in
beauty. The foot may be described as
plough-shaped and is admirably adapted
for digging rapidly in the sand, so that
the shell may be hidden from sight on the
approach of enemies. The long siphon is
thrust up through the canal in the anterior
part of the shell and its end protrudes
above the sand. The high polish
of the surface is due to the shell being
enveloped in the voluminous foot; hence
it has no epidermis. The aperture is so
narrow that it is difficult to understand
how the animal gets in and out. The
olives are very numerous in individuals;
when one is found hundreds are sure to
reward a patient search.</p>
<p>Probably no more distinct family of
mollusks exists than the Conidae, the
family of cones, their beautifully decorated
shells and the large number of species
making them a favorite with collectors.
The shell is in the form of an inverted
cone, gracefully rounded, the aperture
being but a narrow slit extending
nearly the whole length of the shell. The
colors of the cones are always very brilliant,
although when they are alive the
shell is not brilliantly polished as the
olives, on account of the presence of an
epidermis. About three hundred species
are known, living principally in tropical
seas. They love to conceal themselves in
holes in the rocks and among the
branches of corals. The animal is predaceous,
boring into the shells of other
mollusks and extracting the juices from
the bodies. The teeth of Conus are hollow
and very sharp and have a barb on
the end. A poison gland is said to be
present in this genus and bites from the
animal are very painful, although not
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
dangerous, the large Conus marmoreus
being able to inflict a severe wound. The
cone is quite pugnacious and will immediately
bite the hand when picked up, a
veritable reptile of the ocean.</p>
<p>The ne plus ultra of mollusks to the
collector is without doubt the genus Cypraea,
comprising the cowry shells. So
eagerly have they been sought by wealthy
collectors that the price of rarities has
gone up to an astonishing degree, some
specimens being sold at several hundred
dollars each. The shell is highly polished,
owing to the fact that two lobes of the
voluminous mantle are turned back over
the shell and meet in the middle of the
back. The foot is very large and spreading,
the mantle beset with curious little
tentacular-like organs and the eyes are
placed on small swellings near the base
of the long, cylindrical tentacles. The
color-patterns of the shell vary to a wonderful
degree. The young shell has a
thin epidermis, a sharp lip to the aperture
and a more or less prominent spire,
the rolled over and toothed lip and polished
surface not being acquired until
fully adult. No more beautiful sight can
be imagined than one of these gorgeous
animals, as seen through the clear water,
crawling over the sandy bottom or on
the branch of some coral.</p>
<p>Several of the cowries have a curious
economic value. Thus, Cypraea aurantia,
the orange cowry, was used as an insignia
of royalty by the chiefs of the
Friendly Islands, and for a long time the
only specimens obtainable were those
which had been bored and used. The
money cowry (Cypraea moneta) has been
used as money by the natives of Western
Africa, and many tons of this small shell
were annually imported to England to be
used in barter by the African traders.
The shell is of a yellowish or whitish
color, does not exceed an inch in length,
and is very common in the Pacific and
Indian Oceans. It is still used as a medium
of barter in parts of Africa, although
other things have pretty generally
taken its place.</p>
<p>Cameos were at one time quite in the
fashion, both as ornaments for the person
in the way of brooches, and as bric-a-brac
about the room. These shell-cameos
are made from the genus Cassis,
the helmet shells. These are well adapted
for this purpose, as the shell is made
up of several differently colored layers,
making a bas relief figure not only possible
but very effective. The black helmet
(Cassis madagascariensis) is one of
the best for this purpose, the figure being
carved from the white, outer layer of
shell, which stands out very clearly
against the black background of the second
layer. When a cameo is desired
simply as a brooch or for any other form
of personal adornment, a piece of the
shell is cut out and shaped into the required
form and size&mdash;oval, square or
other shape&mdash;and cemented to a block of
wood. The figure is then traced on the
shell with a pencil and finally carefully
worked out with sharp, pointed steel instruments,
of delicate size and form. The
same process is resorted to in working
out a bas relief on the entire shell, only
the latter is placed in a vice or other object
to hold it firmly. The home of this
industry is Genoa and Rome, Italy, although
some are produced in France;
these latter, however, are of a poorer
quality. Several thousand people are employed
in this trade. Many beautiful examples
of this work were exhibited at the
World&rsquo;s Columbian Exposition, in Chicago,
in 1893.</p>
<p>The cameo shells are among the largest
of sea snails, several of them measuring
eight or ten inches in length and weighing
several pounds. They are found only
in tropical and subtropical seas, living in
comparatively shallow waters on a sandy
bottom. They are voracious eaters, living
principally on bivalve mollusks.</p>
<p>One of the most abundant of mollusks
is the violet sea snail (Ianthina communis),
which spends its life floating in
the waters of the Atlantic Ocean. The
shell is very delicate, resembling in form
some of the land snails, and has but two
colors, both shades of violet, a deep color
on the under side (which, by the way, is
always turned upward when the animal is
floating in the water), and a lighter shade
on the upper side. So fragile is the shell
that it seems as if a breath would break
it. The most interesting fact in connection
with this mollusk is the wonderful
float or &ldquo;raft&rdquo; which is secreted by the
foot, and to the under side of which the
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
eggs are attached. The latter are not all
in the same condition. Nearest to the
animal they are more or less fresh; those
in the middle of the float contain embryos
and fully formed young, while those on
the outer end are empty, the young having
escaped into the water. The genus is
gregarious and may be found in almost
countless numbers. After a severe storm
they are sometimes cast upon the beaches
in vast numbers, where they soon die
under the fierce rays of the sun.</p>
<p>We have thus far been dealing with
snails whose shells were formed in a
spiral coil. Quite a number of mollusks
are not protected by such a shell, its place
being taken by a flat, shield-like disk, or
several distinct plates placed side by side.
The most familiar of the first is the limpet
or Patella, which is a depressed, conical,
oval disk, looking not unlike a miniature
shield. They live on rocks, to which they
cling with great tenacity. The animal
seems to have a pretty clear idea of local
geography, for it invariably returns to
the same place after its excursions for
food and the rock in some localities has
been hollowed out to a considerable depth
by the continuous dwelling thereon of
the limpet. The large foot is very strong
and it is almost impossible to dislodge
the shell from the rock when the animal
becomes alarmed and is aware that danger
is near. While grazing along the
sides of a rock covered with fine sea-weed,
it will leave a track like a worm and
will clean off quite an area in a very short
space of time.</p>
<p>Another species is the key-hole limpet
(Fissurella), distinguished by having a
slit or foramen in the apex of the shell.
The shells of Fissurella are generally
rougher than those of Patella, and as a
rule they live in warmer seas. In the
limpet we find a departure from the general
form of both animal and shell, both
being bilaterally symmetrical, that is,
having both sides alike. In the mollusks
which have been presented thus far,
the body has been twisted in the form of
a spiral, making one side different from
the other and causing the organs of one
side to become atrophied. In the limpets
the organs are paired, as they are supposed
to have been in the ancestors of the
living mollusks.</p>
<p>The most peculiar of all the mollusks,
so peculiar, indeed, that they constitute
a separate order (Polyplacophora) are
the Chitons, or coat-of-mail shells. The
shell is made up of eight separate pieces
or plates, each locking with the other, the
whole supported by and buried in a coriaceous
mantle which forms a margin all
the way around. This must not be confounded
with the true mantle of the animal,
for it is only a part of the shell. It is
beset with bristles, spines or hairs, which
add much to the peculiar appearance of
this mollusk.</p>
<p>The Chitons live for the most part on
rocks at low water and are said to be
nocturnal in habit, feeding only at night.
Their movements are slow and they appear
to be very sluggish in all their actions.
When detached and taken from
their rocky homes they have the provoking
(to the collector) habit of rolling up
and are sometimes very difficult to
straighten out again. There are about
two hundred and fifty living species,
found in all parts of the world.</p>
<p>In the foregoing pages we have called
attention to a few types of marine snails,
and what has been written has hardly
more than touched upon this vast field.
There are thousands of different species
even more interesting than those which
have been mentioned. There are the
beautiful ear shells, or Abalones, the little
periwinkle, so largely used as an article
of food in Europe, besides a host of
others too numerous to mention. The
brief notes and the figures on the plate
will convince the reader, it is hoped, that
these inhabitants of the deep are not only
beautiful and worthy of our attention and
study, but are also of much practical and
economical use to man.</p>

<h2 id="c20">THE LEMON.</h2>
<p>In 1636 an English report on the
affairs of the navy gravely remarked
that &ldquo;the use of lemon is a precious
medicine and well tried. Take two or
three spoonfuls each morning and fast
after it two hours.&rdquo; The value of the
fruit for certain disorders of the system
seems to have received an early recognition.
This was especially true with
regard to scurvy, which in earlier days
caused widespread mortality among
seafaring men. Hawkins, in 1593, made
the statement that more than ten thousand
men had succumbed to the malady
within the limits of his naval experience.
The Crusaders under Louis IX.
were severely attacked by scurvy, owing
to their abstinence from fresh meat
during Lent, and the history of the disease
shows that it is occasioned by a
lack of fresh meat and fruits. The
efficacy of lemon juice was recognized
by Drake, Davy, Cavendish, Dampier
and many others years ago, and time
has but added to the value of the fruit,
while it has made it accessible to everyone.
While Pomona is generally credited
with having devoted her entire attention
to the cultivation of the apple,
it is stated on authority of an old
Greek myth, that she gave considerable
thought to the development of the
Lemon and the orange. It appears that
Pomona inclined not her ear to the
supplications of her many admirers
until Vertumnus, discerning her vulnerable
point, presented the fair gardener
with a grafting, which, under her skillful
cultivation, developed into a lemon
tree, and, as a reward, the favor of the
wood-nymph was bestowed upon the
youth.</p>
<p>Whether or not such was the origin
of the Lemon, the fact remains that the
fruit is most useful and the tree exceedingly
attractive. Originally a native of
Asia, it has become widely distributed
in Europe, Africa and America, and
although far more susceptible to injury
from frosts than the orange, the trees
are successfully cultivated under many
conditions. Doubtless the best results
in this country have been obtained in
California. Thousands of acres around
San Diego are planted with lemon trees
while large districts in the Ojai Valley,
Ventura, Santa Barbara, Pomona and
Los Angeles counties are devoted to its
cultivation. The tree is remarkable for
beauty, and while it seldom attains
large proportions, its pale green leaves,
loosely-hanging branches, showy and
fragrant flowers, together with the fruit
that is found in all stages of development,
produce a pleasing and highly
ornamental effect. While the best
crop of Lemons is generally gathered
between December and April,
the fruit should be picked every
month for ten months of the year,
in order to retain the best results.
As a rule, the trees yield from
one hundred and twenty-five to one
hundred and forty boxes of the fruit to
the acre, about the sixth year, but this
number is increased to four hundred
boxes when the groves reach an age of
ten years.</p>
<p>The varieties of Lemons are distinguished
chiefly by their size and form,
and may be roughly classified as egg-shaped
with blunt nipples and oblong
lemons with large nipples. The
sweet lemon and thin-rind Poncine and
Naples belong to the first class, while
the second includes such forms as the
imperial, the Ga&euml;ta and the wax. The
principal varieties grown in California
are the Lisbon, Eureka and the Villa-Franca.
Of these, the Eureka originated
in California, while the Villa-Franca
was imported from Europe.
Besides the grateful quality of the juice,
the expressed oil of the rind is used in
the arts and has an intense odor of
lemon, and the Pundits of Benares,
quote a Sanskrit work, written about
1354, in which the oil is described as a
valuable medicine. The acid pulp of
the Lemon, after rasping off the rind, is
pressed for citric acid, while the ottos
of the Lemon, orange and bergamot,
the preparation of which forms the
chief industry of Sicily, are leading
ingredients in the preparation of &ldquo;Lisbon
Water&rdquo; and &ldquo;Eau de Portugal.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c21">TWO WRENS.</h2>
<p>The house wren is one of Nature&rsquo;s illuminated
successes. It has been said that
there is no second spring, yet to-day (July
20th) this bird is in the full glory of
spring-time melody. He sings from the
top of a telegraph pole, the song caught
up and repeated by some country cousin
in the grove, a musical argument carried
on all day long and left at night in the
same unsettled state in which morning
found it. Whether they are discussing
the relative merit of their respective
claims, a town residence or a country
seat, I am unable to decide; it is certain,
however, that the concessions of neither
party infringe upon domestic dignity.</p>
<p>Their speech is a revelation of supreme
content, a liquid, flexible measure with
ripples and cascades bubbling through
and over, a dash of pure color amid July&rsquo;s
neutral tinted emotions.</p>
<p>The day may be dark and threatening,
the sun concealed in gloomy banks of
cloud, rain falling, or thick mists obscuring
the valley; each and all are powerless
to dampen his ardor or to effect his extreme
optimism. He clings to his creed
with persistent closeness, asserting valiantly
the ecstasy of finding one&rsquo;s self
alive and emphasizing the statement by
a perfect wave of melodious argument.</p>
<p>There are hours when he sings with
such force that his whole little body
catches the key-note and natural rhythm;
the melody becomes compounded of his
very substance, body of his body and soul
of his soul. It is an inundation of musical
notes, cascadic, cataclysmic, the tide
of song rising till it drowns his personality;
he is no longer a bird but an animated
song.</p>
<p>My little neighbor is a pattern of husbandly
devotion, a lover-husband over
whom coming events are already casting
tender shadows before, the special event
in this instance being located in a crevice
beneath the eaves of the house.</p>
<p>Wren babies had not left the first nest
when Jenny Wren&rsquo;s husband was hard
at work upon a second house, which was
ready for occupancy before the first family
were self-supporting. This was an
admirable arrangement in the way of
time-saving, as eggs are often laid in the
second nest before the first is vacated.</p>
<p>Though the new house lacked the
freshness of coloring and the picturesqueness
of the swing of a nest in the
sunshine, Jenny Wren made no complaint
of being cooped up in the darkness,
and as to her husband, he was quite as
well pleased with the glamor and wonder
of its art as if it had been wound with
blossoms and sprinkled with star-dust.
A bird with different tastes might have
urged that it was only a little hole in the
house-jet, yet everything in life depends
upon the point of view from which you
regard it. Judged from the wren standpoint,
it was considered admirably adapted
to the family needs, nor could the most
critical observer fail to see here a literal
illustration of that familiar truth: Happiness
is from within.</p>
<p>Standing upon a ladder I counted eight
eggs as my eyes became gradually accustomed
to the partial darkness within the
nest; the dark, vinaceous spots laid on so
thickly as to conceal or obliterate the
original color, thus helping to hide them
more securely. In the long brooding
days, when Jenny&rsquo;s little answering heart
is preoccupied and silent, the hours are
sometimes long and lonely to her mate.
At these times he has been known to devote
his spare moments to building a nest
simply for his own pleasure. Many instances
of this remarkable habit are recorded
of the English wren, the explanation
offered being that the odd nests are
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">186</span>
for the purpose of deceiving the parasitical
cuckoo.</p>
<p>There is also a supposition that the
bird&rsquo;s active nature finds relief in work,
being urged on by the increasing lonesomeness.
This wren-trait reaches a climax
in the marsh wrens, with whom the
building habit becomes a passion.</p>
<p>Nor is it restricted to the wren family,
many instances being recorded where
other species have beguiled the waiting
days by an imitative housekeeping.</p>
<p>The house phoebe has been known to
build a second nest while its mate was
brooding. To all appearances this was
an instance of over-developed domestic
tastes. Nor did the experiment end with
the completion of the duplicate nest upon
which the male bird sat regularly for several
hours daily.</p>
<p>Wrens do not take kindly to double
houses, their warlike nature seeming to
revolt against living friendly with near
neighbors. A pair of wrens that was
well established in an unoccupied martin
house made it very uncomfortable for the
later arrivals. While the martins were
abroad after material for the nest the
wrens sallied forth in an utterly vindictive
spirit and scratched out all their
neighbors had constructed. After singing
a triumphant song with much parade
they wisely retired to their own domicile
to be on the defensive.</p>
<p>Wiser wrens, with an instinctive
knowledge that an ounce of prevention is
worth a pound of cure, are known to
have the forethought when the box in
which they build contains two compartments,
to fill up one of them, thus avoiding
the risk of troublesome neighbors.
Wrens have been known to nest in a human
skull. Others with less questionable
taste, have gone to housekeeping in
an old boot, a watering pot, a coat sleeve;
in gourds and baskets, jars and water
pipes, while another pair made a nest in
the lower part of a stone vase in the garden.
There was a hole for drainage in
the bottom of the vase, and through this
hole they found, beneath some shavings,
a circular space just suited for a nest.
The vase was not filled with plants until
the domestic affairs of the wren family
were happily concluded.</p>
<p>The delicate swaying hammock of the
oriole is sometimes used for a second
nesting.</p>
<p>There was bitter disappointment in
wren circles earlier in the season when,
with the presumption of inexperience, the
pump was filled regularly with coarse
twigs, which were promptly dislodged at
nightfall. Undiscouraged at this defeat,
the morning hours were utilized for rebuilding
with a persistency well worthy
a more intelligent effort; they worked
and sang, sang and worked, until a cigar
box was nailed to a tree for their special
accommodation. This was nearly full of
twigs when they decided that the building-site
was ineligible, a decision hastened
by the fact that just at this opportune
time a glass fruit can was left upon
the piazza shelf. No sooner was this
glass house seen than its possibilities
were realized and plans were quickly
made for a kind of crystal palace experiment.
Under other circumstances this
might have been a dangerous precedent,
as certain unneighborly conduct toward
their little brothers of the air had at various
times fairly invited the throwing of
stones. The can was half full of tiny
fagots, and Jenny was thinking of settling
upon the mattress of wood fibre when
the thrifty housewife turned them adrift
summarily, well aware that this kind of
housekeeping, within easy range of
neighboring cats, would not be successful.
Before such supreme content, who
could have the heart to undeceive them?
And yet, the can was turned upside down
before they could be made to understand
the situation. Like Thoreau, they did
not wish to practice self-denial unless it
was quite necessary!</p>
<p>After the failure of this crystal scheme,
it was a difficult matter for Jenny to
make up her mind as to a further preference,
but when she really decided it was
with such entire good faith as left no
doubt in her lover&rsquo;s mind as to her judgment.
This was more flattering as it was
his own choice, their last year&rsquo;s home
thoroughly remodeled, to which he had
repeatedly called her attention, vainly. So
the hole in the house jet at least answered
the question, &ldquo;Where are the birds in last
year&rsquo;s nests?&rdquo; for the wrens moved in
regularly, the tenor having a perch upon
a projecting bracket where Jenny joined
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
him, a regular little termagant, scolding
with all her might whenever the kittens
looked that way.</p>
<p>Marsh wrens, small brown birds, with
barred wings and tail, breed in or about
the swamps and marshes of Lake Champlain.</p>
<p>They are intensely interesting from
their habit of constructing several nests
but one of which is utilized for housekeeping.
After the real nest is made and
the first egg laid, the male stays closely
at home busying itself with building several
nests, which are to all appearances
entirely superfluous. In locating these
he does not go beyond the immediate
neighborhood of the true nest.</p>
<p>Some have thought that these sham
nests are used as hiding places for the
male, a Lilliputian watch tower or guard
house, from which close watch is kept
over the home property. Whether Mrs.
Marsh Wren really needs such close
watching, being more inclined to flirt
than the ordinary feathered spouse, or
because she is a better wife, so infinitely
precious that she must be guarded from
every side, is, as yet, an unsolved question.
&ldquo;Love holds the key to all unknown,&rdquo;
and though there is little to admire
in a deportment made fine by compulsory
measures, no doubt both parties
understand the situation, which is quite
enough for practical purposes. These
nests, conspicuous from their size and
exposed position, are securely attached
to the upright swaying reeds, some of
which penetrate their substance. They
are lined with soft grasses and have an
entrance at one side, often nearer the
bottom than the top. Mr. Burroughs,
who has found the marsh wren&rsquo;s nest
surrounded by half a dozen make-believes,
says the gushing, ecstatic nature
of the bird expresses itself in this way.
It is simply so full of life and joy and of
parental instinct that it gives vent to itself
in constructing sham nests; the generous-hearted
creature being willing to
build and support more homes than can
be furnished or utilized.</p>
<p>Entering the Lake Shore drive at St.
Albans Bay, where dense tangles border
the swamp beyond, you are sure to hear
a song that is unmistakably wrennish.
You have glimpses also of a small brown
bird bubbling over with a nervous energy
that betrays itself in every note he utters.
Wait quietly and he approaches,
but go one step in his direction and he
recedes to the swamp where human foot
may not follow.</p>
<p>Push your boat up the creek, the only
avenue leading to his abode, that tantalizing
song leading on meanwhile like the
Pied Piper of Hamelin, though unlike the
latter there is no disillusioning at the end.
Red-winged blackbirds take wing as you
enter the twilight of soft green and amber
shade and the far-off music of their
jangle-bells becomes less musical, the
males striving &ldquo;to recommend themselves
by music, like some awkward youth who
serenades his mistress with a jewsharp,&rdquo;
and using the air or the alder tops as a
parade ground upon which to exhibit
their musical evolutions. And yet you
are witness to many a voluntary bit of
sentiment that will increase your interest
in this scarlet epauletted regiment, descendants
of the dusky tribe that anchored
long ago in this peaceful haven, going
out and coming in with the tide until the
legend of their coming is as vague and
shadowy and misty as that of the golden-fleece
voyageurs&mdash;the Argonauts. They
ebbed and flowed with the stream; came
at the proper time and season without
knowing why; anchored and launched
their ebony ships when it was time for
sailing.</p>
<p>Here and there along this waterway
the branches clasp hands above the creek,
forming an arch of green within which
vines sufficiently elegant to warrant exclusiveness
cling in unaffected grace to
the alders, without inquiring or caring
as to the pedigree of their support. It is
sufficient for them that the support is
there.</p>
<p>A whole half mile along the stream and
trees and bushes disappear, leaving a
dense mass of reeds, the marsh wren&rsquo;s
&ldquo;ain countrie,&rdquo; out of which he is never
at his best and to which he gives you no
welcome.</p>
<p>Birds, like persons, have wonderful
powers of concentration upon one topic,
woe be to you if that topic happens to be
yourself!</p>
<p>Every denizen of the swamp regards
you with suspicion, watching each movement
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
as closely as if you were a dangerous
character traveling under an alias,
and could not be trusted to sail upon this
ruddy ocean in which their lordships
have anchored their private yachts. Push
your boat far in among the reeds and cat-tails,
into the sea of shadows over which
no sluggish current sends a ripple, and
certain globular nests in the tangled
reeds reward your search. Push your
fingers within these nests and in one only,
here and there, will you find from five to
ten dark eggs, a rich reward for all your
trouble.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the &ldquo;neighbors,&rdquo; and the
marsh wren generally has numbers of
them, have doubtless been charming you
with their bubbling, gurgling song, always
half the colony singing at once, or,
one bird rising above the reeds gives the
order, as it were, and the whole colony
joins in the chorus. The song is quite beyond
their control; they seem filled to
overflowing with an inexhaustible supply
of music, which trickles down the reeds,
like gathered-up drops of water charged
with music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes, like a mine of melody, it
explodes within them and lifts them from
the dark recesses of the flags into the air
above.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="bq">Aromatics, as cubebs, cinnamons and nutmegs, are usually put into crude poor wines
to give them more oily spirits.&mdash;Floyer, &ldquo;The Humors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cubeb-yielding plant is not unlike
the pepper plant and belongs to the same
family (Piperaceae). The two resemble
each other in general habits in the form
of inflorescence and in the fruiting.</p>
<p>Cubebs were known to Arabian physicians
as early as the ninth century, who
employed them as a diuretic in kidney
troubles. It was also known at that time
that Java was the home of the plant. At
one time it was believed that the Carpesium
of ancient writers was cubebs, but
this is now generally disbelieved. Edrisi
states that cubeb found its way to Aden
about 1153. During the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries it was employed medicinally
in Spain. Originally it was doubtless
employed as a spice, similar to pepper.
Mariano Sanudo (1306) classed it among
the rare and costly spices. Hildegard referred
to the soothing properties of cubeb.
In the thirteenth century cubeb is mentioned
among the import articles of London.
About the same time it found its
way into other European countries, notably
Germany. At the beginning of the
nineteenth century cubeb disappeared almost
entirely from medical practice.
About 1820 English physicians of Java
again began to employ it quite extensively.</p>
<p>As in the case of black pepper, the fruit
is collected before maturity and dried.
The fruit is about the size of the pepper,
but has a stalk-like prolongation which
distinguishes it. The pericarp becomes
much shriveled and wrinkled on drying.</p>
<p>Cubebs are cultivated in special plantations
or with coffee for which they provide
shade by spreading from the trees
which serve as their support. Their cultivation
is said to be easy.</p>
<p>Cubebs have a pungent, bitter taste and
a characteristic aromatic odor. It cannot
readily be confounded with any of the
other more common spices. Its use as a
spice is almost wholly discontinued. Its
use in medicine is also waning, since it
evidently has only slight medicinal properties.
It is used in nasal and other
catarrhal affections. Cubeb cigarettes
are used in the treatment of nasal catarrh.
It has a marked influence upon the kidneys,
causing irritation and increased activity,
and as already indicated it is therefore
a diuretic. It is, however, harmful,
rather than beneficial, in acute inflammatory
conditions of these organs.</p>
